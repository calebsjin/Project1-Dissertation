### 1. Genes selected by proposed method

- 1. [RPL27][RPL27-link] (Ribosomal Protein L27) in genecards.org or [NCBI]("https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6155") say:
    - Entrez Gene Summary for RPL27 Gene:

      >This gene encodes a member of the L27e family of ribosomal proteins and a component of the 60S subunit. A splice site mutation in this gene has been identified in a **Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA)** patient. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2017]

    - GeneCards Summary for RPL27 Gene:

      >RPL27 (Ribosomal Protein L27) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with RPL27 include Diamond-Blackfan Anemia 16 and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia. Among its related pathways are Viral mRNA Translation and Influenza Viral RNA Transcription and Replication. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include structural constituent of ribosome.

- 2. C10orf76 is descript in [wiki]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10orf76") as follows:

    >C10orf76 or chromosome 10 open reading frame 76, also known as UPF0668, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the c10orf76 gene. **Its function is not currently known**, but experimental evidence has suggested that it may be involved in transcriptional regulation.

- 3. [DTL][DTL-link] in genecards.org is described as:
    - GeneCards Summary for DTL Gene:

      >DTL (Denticleless E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase Homolog) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with DTL include **Myasthenic Syndrome, Congenital, 8**. Among its related pathways are Translesion synthesis by Y family DNA polymerases bypasses lesions on DNA template and DNA Double-Strand Break Repair. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include **ubiquitin-protein transferase activity**.

- 4. [NBR2][NBR2-link] in genecards.org is described as:
    - Entrez Gene Summary for NBR2 Gene:

      >This gene was identified by **its close proximity on chromosome 17 to tumor suppressor gene BRCA1.** Experimental evidence indicates that the two genes share a **bi-directional promoter**. Transcription for either gene is controlled individually by distinct transcriptional repressor factors. A short (112 amino acid) open reading frame is observed which includes a region derived from a LINE1 element. A strong Kozak signal is not observed for the putative ORF and the stop codon is more than 55 nucleotides upstream of the last splice site for the transcript, suggesting that the transcript is subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Therefore, this gene does not appear to encode a protein. Glucose starvation induces the expression of this gene and the long non-coding RNA transcribed by it functions with AMP-activated protein kinase in mediating the energy stress response.

    - GeneCards Summary for NBR2 Gene:

      >NBR2 (Neighbor Of BRCA1 LncRNA 2) is an RNA Gene, and is affiliated with the non-coding RNA class. Diseases associated with NBR2 include **Adamantinoma Of Long Bones and Pancreatic Cancer 4**.

In rodents and other mammals this gene product is found in the cytoplasm localized with a calcium channel membrane protein, and is thought to play a role in **brain development**. **Mutations** in this gene are associated with **autosomal recessive nonsyndromic cognitive disability**. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]

    - GeneCards Summary for CRBN Gene:  

      >CRBN (Cereblon) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with CRBN include **Mental Retardation, Autosomal Recessive 2 and Autosomal Recessive Non-Syndromic Intellectual Disability**. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include **ATP-dependent peptidase activity**.

      >This gene encodes a member of the DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) subfamily of proteins, part of the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box family of RNA helicases. The encoded protein binds to N6-methyladenosine, a common modified RNA nucleotide that is enriched in the stop codons and 3' UTRs of eukaryotic messenger RNAs. Binding of proteins to this modified nucleotide may regulate mRNA translation and stability. This gene may be associated with susceptibility to **pancreatic cancer** in human patients, and knockdown of this gene resulted in reduced proliferation in a human **liver cancer** cell line. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016]

    - GeneCards Summary for YTHDC2 Gene:

      >YTHDC2 (YTH Domain Containing 2) is a Protein Coding gene. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include **nucleic acid binding and helicase activity**.

- 7. [CMTM5][CMTM5-link] in genecards.org is described as:
    - Entrez Gene Summary for CMTM5 Gene:

      >This gene encodes a member of the chemokine-like factor superfamily. This family of genes encodes multi-pass membrane proteins that are similar to both the chemokine and the transmembrane 4 superfamilies of signaling molecules. The encoded protein may **exhibit tumor suppressor activity**. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]
