</ol>
<ul>
<li>Entrez Gene Summary for NBR2 Gene:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This gene was identified by <strong>its close proximity on chromosome 17 to tumor suppressor gene BRCA1.</strong> Experimental evidence indicates that the two genes share a <strong>bi-directional promoter</strong>. Transcription for either gene is controlled individually by distinct transcriptional repressor factors. A short (112 amino acid) open reading frame is observed which includes a region derived from a LINE1 element. A strong Kozak signal is not observed for the putative ORF and the stop codon is more than 55 nucleotides upstream of the last splice site for the transcript, suggesting that the transcript is subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Therefore, this gene does not appear to encode a protein. Glucose starvation induces the expression of this gene and the long non-coding RNA transcribed by it functions with AMP-activated protein kinase in mediating the energy stress response.
